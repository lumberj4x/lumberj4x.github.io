### General coding practice

lumberj4x coding practice

-Name repos in the style of (Project)-(Sub-Project)
-Make sure to leave a detailed description of your last commit
-When coding, leave a line in between chunks of code. This makes it easy to read
-Make comments in your code that explain the current chunk
-Don't touch other peoples code if you dont know what it does
-Always make a pull request instead of directly commiting to master, this way, the member that maintains that code can approve it.
-If you need help, ask for it
